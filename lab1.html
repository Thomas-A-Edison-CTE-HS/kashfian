    <h1>All About the Aurora Borealis</h1>
        <p>Everyone should know of the recent Aurora Borealis that happened on October 11th. Here are some interesting facts about this event!</p>
<!--Section 1-->
        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>The Aurora Borealis is a natural phenomanon that occurs when solar activity sends charged particles to Earth's magnetic field. These particles collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere. When these particles and gases collide, it leads to kinetic energy transforming into visible light in shades of blue, purple, green, and red. The reason behind all these different colors is due to the gases and altitude, each condition producing it's own color.</p>
        <br>
            <ul>    
                <li>Green can be seen with oxygen molecules colliding with the particles at 100-300 kilometers in the atmosphere.</li>
                <li>Pink can be seen with nitrogen molecules at around 100 kilometers.</li>
                <li>Red can be seen with oxygen molecules at 300-400 kilometers.</li>
                <li>Blue and purple are seen when particles collide with nitrogen at 97 kilometers.</li>
            </ul>
