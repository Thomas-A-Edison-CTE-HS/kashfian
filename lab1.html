    <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>The Aurora Borealis is a natural phenomanon that occurs when solar activity sends charged particles to Earth's magnetic field. These particles collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere. When these particles and gases collide, it leads to kinetic energy transforming into visible light in shades of blue, purple, green, and red. The reason behind all these different colors is due to the gases and altitude, each condition producing it's own color.</p>
            <ul>    
                <li>Green can be seen with oxygen molecules colliding with the particles at 100-300 kilometers in the atmosphere.</li>
                <li>Pink can be seen with nitrogen molecules at around 100 kilometers.</li>
                <li>Red can be seen with oxygen molecules at 300-400 kilometers.</li>
                <li>Blue and purple are seen when particles collide with nitrogen at 97 kilometers.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Sightings</h2>
        <p>People have been seeing this phenomenon since ancient times, the first sighting being in 567 BC in Babylon. The Aurora can be seen year-round, but September to March offers the best viewing experience. The winter nights provide darker nights and when combined with areas with little light pollution allow for a vivid expereince. Some countries with upcoming Aurora's are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Iceland</li>
                <li>Norway</li>
                <li>Sweden</li>
                <li>Canada</li>
                <li>Greenland</li>
            </ol>
